## Financial data - how hard can it be?

I've worked with financial data for years, and a recurring theme is that it is harder than it initially appears. Once you start to scratch the surface, it quickly becomes apparent that financial data is far, far from simple. 

So I thought it might be useful to dig into this and explain why. Let's start with an example.

## A stock price history


| Date | Price |
|------------|------------:|
| 2018-06-05 | 256 |
| 2018-06-06 | 258 |
| 2018-06-07 | 270 |

etc

What could be complicated about that?

Well, lets examine what these values actually mean.

Firstly, we need to understand what a stock actually is. Then we need to understand what a price is, and how a price for a stock might actually originate, and then finally we have to understand the date part.

What is a stock?
