## Financial data - how hard can it be?

I've worked with financial data for years, and a recurring theme is that it is harder than it initially appears. Once you start to scratch the surface, it quickly becomes apparent that financial data is far, far from simple. 

So I thought it might be useful to dig into this and explain why. Let's start with an example.

## A stock price history


| Date | Price |
| 2018-06-05 | 256 |
| 2018-06-06 | 258 |
| 2018-06-07 | 270 |

etc
